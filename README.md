# ID_Assignment_1_S10208650
This is a repository for my ID assignment 1 

The purpose of this website is to have an overview of my personal portfolio. My portfolio includes all my past working and internship experience, certifications , testimonials, educational history, and skills that i have. The personal portfolio that i have provided is for my future employers or recruiters, for them to know more about me and to see the level of skills that i have.

## Design Process
For the design process i have decided to come out with a simple layout and a single page scroll where potential recruiters will have a comfortable experiecnce navigating around my website. Hence during my first thought i quickly sketch out this idea into my XD wireframe. I have also added some space in my XD wireframe so that i will have enought space for me to insert all my certifications with the right size and space(one entire portion of a webpage) so that the potential recruits can analyze and have a quick idea on what are some of my skills and the knowledge i have. More over, i have designed my webpage to be compatible with many other web browsers so that browswer such as microsoft edge, opera, google chrome and etc will be allowed to open up my personal portfolio site that i have created. Devices such as phones and tablets are also readable, with the use of media queries.



## Features
### Existing Features
- the user can always use the navigation menu that i have created at the top of the webpage to move between sections between the webpage without getting lost.
- embeded social media icons button, to allow recruiters to connect with me easily 
- an embeded resume button, so that it will direct them to another website for further information about me.
- it is supported through many devices, ranging from phone, tablets to computers.
- arrow up and down button to bring users right to the bottom or top of the webpage

## Technologies Used

## Testing
- using of w3school code validator to test out my overall coding to see if there is any error
- testing of social media links to see if they are able to open it successfully when the button is being clicked
- making sure that the intended image should appear in the correct area i wanted it to be
- making sure that i am able to upload all my certifications on the webpage
- i have tested my webpage on every single web browser that i could think of
