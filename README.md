# ID_Assignment_1_S10208650
This is a repository for my ID assignment 1 

The purpose of this website is to have an overview of my personal portfolio. My portfolio includes all my past working and internship experience, certifications , testimonials, educational history, and skills that i have. The personal portfolio that i have provided is for my future employers or recruiters, for them to know more about me and to see the level of skills that i have.

## Design Process
For the design process i have decided to come out with a simple layout and a single page scroll where potential recruiters will have a comfortable experiecnce navigating around my website. Hence during my first thought i quickly sketch out this idea into my XD wireframe. I have also added some space in my XD wireframe so that i will have enought space for me to insert all my certifications with the right size and space(one entire portion of a webpage) so that the potential recruits can analyze and have a quick idea on what are some of my skills and the knowledge i have. More over, i have designed my webpage to be compatible with many other web browsers so that browswer such as microsoft edge, opera, google chrome and etc will be allowed to open up my personal portfolio site that i have created. Devices such as phones and tablets are also readable, with the use of media queries.
